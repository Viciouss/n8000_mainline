# HW Revisions

* code references multiple versions of the tablet with changing hardware
* officially checked in code are 5, 6 and 7 to 9 but there could be others
** version <= 5 -> ?
*** is this the N8000?
** version 6 -> confirmed N8010 on own hardware
*** for some reason the comment mentions 3G but that should be version 5?
*** what about N8013?
** version 7 -> reserved (see los kernel p4-input.c line 122)
** version 8 -> same as 0.7
** version 9 -> LTE model such as N8020 (does this also include the N8015?
